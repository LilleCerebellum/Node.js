    <p style="color: white; font-family: 'poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 30px;border-radius: 5px; border-color: black;"> “Intelligent American GIs, why have you come to Vietnam?

Your government has betrayed you. There is nothing noble about your mission. There is no reason why you should be here. You will never defeat the forces of our Fatherland. The French never learned. Will you?

Do you miss your families and homes? They are questioning why you are here. In America there is no unity, there is violence, there are protests against you.

Why are you here? When you sit alone at night and think of your loved ones, our gallant soldiers are watching you. You cannot escape.

Do you have a watch, American servicemen? Look at it, the minutes are ticking away. Soon your time will stop in Vietnam. You will be killed when you least expect it.

Your imperialist government will never defeat us. Our soldiers are politically motivated and strong. You are weak. You have no cause. No one wants you here. Why do you stay? Tell your officers you want to go home, GI. Tell them you will not fight anymore. Tell them you are defeated.

Look at the photos of your loved ones, American soldier. Do you miss them? Do you miss your parents? Your wife? Your children? What will they do when your imperialist government tells them you died in Vietnam?

There is nothing here for you except defeat and death. Your clock is ticking.”</p>
